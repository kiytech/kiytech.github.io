The volume and tonal character change in relation to the strength and velocity of playing – on a digital piano this system is referred to as “touch sensitivity”.<br>
The Touch Curve setting allows the touch sensitivity of the keyboard to be conveniently adjusted. There are ten different preset touch curve settings available, with two additional “User” settings that allow performers to customise the instrument’s keyboard responsiveness to suit their individual playing style.</p> <p>The default “Normal” setting is designed to accurately recreate the touch of a Kawai concert grand piano. However, if the keyboard feels too light, or fortissimo playing is achieved too easily, it may be desirable to select a heavier touch curve. Alternatively, if the keyboard feels too heavy, or fortissimo playing is too difficult to achieve, it may be desirable to select a lighter touch curve.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Type</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Light(4/3/2/1)</td> <td>Light touch curves require less striking force to achieve a forte note, and are therefore recommended for players with a delicate touch.

The key touch will become progressively heavier as the number increases.</td></tr> <tr><td>Off (constant)</td> <td>A constant volume is produced regardless of how hard the keys are struck.This touch curve intended for playing sounds of instruments that have a fixed dynamic range (e.g. organ and harpsichord).</td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="②-voicing-icon-fingre-tap"><a href="#②-voicing-icon-fingre-tap" class="header-anchor">#</a> ② Voicing [icon_fingre_tap]</h4> <p>On an acoustic piano, the shape, density, and texture of the hammers all influence on the tonal character of the instrument’s sound. Technicians utilise a variety of tools such as needles, files, and brushes to manipulate these hammer felts, with the ultimate goal of achieving a balanced tonal character across the keyboard.<br>
The Voicing setting recreates various hammer properties, allowing the overall tonal character of the digital pianoto be adjusted. There are six different preset voicing settings available (applied uniformly to all keys), with an additional “User” setting allowing players to perform custom adjustments on each individual key.<br>

The digital piano reproduces this sound, with the Damper Noise setting allowing the volume of this sound to be adjusted. The speed at which the damper pedal is pressed and released will also influence the prominence of the damper noise, with fast pedalling creating a more pronounced sound.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Off</td> <td>Damper Noise will not be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>A small amount of Damper Noise will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>～</td> <td>～</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>A large amount of Damper Noise will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="⑥-string-resonance-icon-fingre-drag"><a href="#⑥-string-resonance-icon-fingre-drag" class="header-anchor">#</a> ⑥ String Resonance [icon_fingre_drag]</h4> <p>String Resonance refers to a phenomenon that exists in acoustic pianos whereby the strings of held notes resonate “sympathetically” with other notes of the same harmonic overtone series.<br>

However, the topmost 18 keys (approximately 1.5 octaves) do not incorporate dampers, as the shorter strings for these treble notes decay quickly and therefore do not need to be dampened.<br>
As a result, the strings of these “undamped” treble notes are free to vibrate in sympathetic resonance with those of lower keys – independently of the damper pedal position – helping to enrich the sound with additional harmonics and tonal colour.<br>
The digital piano recreates this phenomenon, with the Undamped String Resonance setting allowing the volume of this resonance sound to be adjusted.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Off</td> <td>Undamped String Resonance will not be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>A small amount of Undamped String Resonance will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>～</td> <td>～</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>A large amount of Undamped String Resonance will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr></tbody></table> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">CHECK</p> <p>This setting will not be displayed when the “SK-EX Rendering” piano sound variation is selected.</p></div> <h4 id="⑧-cabinet-resonance-icon-fingre-drag"><a href="#⑧-cabinet-resonance-icon-fingre-drag" class="header-anchor">#</a> ⑧ Cabinet Resonance [icon_fingre_drag]</h4> <p>While the fundamental sound of an acoustic piano is produced by vibrating strings, transmitting energy through a spruce soundboard, the cabinet of the instrument itself also contributes a variety of subtle tonal characteristics that enrich the playing and listening experience. The keybed, inner and outer rim, iron plate, and beams all play a role in disseminating sound energy, which in turn gives the piano a living, breathing quality.<br>

The digital piano reproduces this sound, with the Fall-back Noise setting allowing the volume of this sound to be adjusted.<br>
While the default value is intended to simulate the natural volume level of the keys as they return to their neutral position, it may occasionally be desirable to adjust the volume of this sound.<br>
For example, reducing the volume when playing very soft pieces, where the fall-back noise may become too prominent.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Off</td> <td>Fall-Back Noise will not be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>A small amount of Fall-Back Noise will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>～</td> <td>～</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>A large amount of Fall-Back Noise will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="⑪-hammer-noise-icon-fingre-drag"><a href="#⑪-hammer-noise-icon-fingre-drag" class="header-anchor">#</a> ⑪ Hammer Noise [icon_fingre_drag]</h4> <p>When playing an acoustic piano, it is also possible to hear the physical sound of the hammers striking the strings, along with the sound of the keys making contacting with the piano keybed.<br>

If desired, the digital piano can recreate this delay, with the Hammer Delay setting allowing the delay length to be adjusted.<br>
While the default value of “Off” is intended to replicate a well-regulated concert grand piano, with an immediate connection between the keyboard and hammers, some players may find it desirable to introduce a minor delay, in order to mimic different types of piano or instruments with a slightly worn keyboard action.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Off</td> <td>Hammer Delay will not be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>A small amount of Hammer Delay will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr> <tr><td>～</td> <td>～</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>A large amount of Hammer Delay will be applied to the selected sound.</td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="⑬-topboard-icon-fingre-tap"><a href="#⑬-topboard-icon-fingre-tap" class="header-anchor">#</a> ⑬ Topboard [icon_fingre_tap]</h4> <p>When playing an acoustic grand piano, the position of the instrument’s topboard (lid) affects both the volume and “openness” of the tone produced.
